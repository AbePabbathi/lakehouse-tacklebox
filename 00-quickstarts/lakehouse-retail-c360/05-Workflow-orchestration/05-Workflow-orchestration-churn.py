# MAGIC
# MAGIC All our assets are ready. We now need to define when we want our DLT pipeline to kick in and refresh the tables.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC One option is to switch DLT pipeline in continuous mode to have a streaming pipeline, providing near-realtime insight.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC An alternative is to wakeup the DLT pipeline every X hours, ingest the new data (incremental) and shut down all your compute. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is a simple configuration offering a tradeoff between uptime and ingestion latencies.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In our case, we decided that the best tradoff is to ingest new data every hours:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Start the DLT pipeline to ingest new data and refresh our tables
# MAGIC - Refresh the DBSQL dashboard (and potentially notify downstream applications)
# MAGIC - Retrain our model to include the lastest date and capture potential behavior change
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <!-- Collect usage data (view). Remove it to disable collection. View README for more details.  -->

# MAGIC <img style="float: right; margin-left: 10px" width="600px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QuentinAmbard/databricks-demo/main/retail/resources/images/lakehouse-retail/lakehouse-retail-churn-workflow.png" />
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A Databricks Workflow is composed of Tasks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Each task can trigger a specific job:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Delta Live Tables
# MAGIC * SQL query / dashboard
# MAGIC * Model retraining / inference
# MAGIC * Notebooks
# MAGIC * dbt
# MAGIC * ...
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this example, can see our 3 tasks:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Start the DLT pipeline to ingest new data and refresh our tables
# MAGIC * Refresh the DBSQL dashboard (and potentially notify downstream applications)
# MAGIC * Retrain our Churn model

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once your workflow is created, we can access historical runs and receive alerts if something goes wrong!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In the screenshot we can see that our workflow had multiple errors, with different runtime, and ultimately got fixed.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Workflow monitoring includes errors, abnormal job duration and more advanced control!
